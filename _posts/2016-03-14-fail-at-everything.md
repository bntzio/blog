Have you ever read something that goes like… *“Learn from mistakes”*, *“Failure is the mother of success”*, *“If you’re not making mistakes, then you’re not doing anything”*, and all sorts of failure quotes?

Well, let me tell you that failure is the most beautiful thing in the world.

We as humans commit errors, and that’s normal, sometimes we screw up x or y, and that’s a good thing, don’t set yourself as a loser, it’s better to fail at everything than at nothing.

Failure can act as your step-stone, as your road to mastery, when we fail at something, we often find discouragement and we feel like crap, but that need to change, become a failure at everything instead, just try out things and expect failure, and yes, learn from your mistakes and do not regret them at all.

When you fail, make that failure your best advantage, learn, grow, and become a master. Use the power of failure, don’t live in the past, live in the present, create a momentum of enlightenment, never stop learning, never stop failing.
Instead of regretting of your failures, catch the inspiration and the will power inside you and become a true master, never give up, and don’t feel bad, because failure is a beautiful thing, is our roadmap for success.

Learn to love failure, and fail at everything, suddenly, you’ll become a winner, a true master of your past because you learned how to drive failure, and you’ll say: **“I’m so lucky I found failures in my life, today they are my strength, they forged the person I am right now”**.
