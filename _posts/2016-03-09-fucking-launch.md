It’s 1:24 AM Wednesday night, I’m sitting next to my coffee, finishing this very old draft (finally) because it’s time, it’s time to **FUCKING LAUNCH**.

For the past 6 years, I’ve been procrastinating, I can’t find another word in the dictionary that describes procrastinating * 1,000… Procrastination is just a diminutive meaning, and as the time passes I realized that I’m wasting my life and I’m going success-blind.

I don’t want to waste your precious time by telling you all my problems, I just want you to know this simple truth of life… **Time is our enemy**.

Are you still here? Awesome, let’s get into it.

<br/>

## Hello World ##

15 years ago, I decided I wanted to be a computer programmer.

![Me](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3WJX6XL_osCD5HQaK5mVJQ.jpeg){: .md-image .image-to-center}

> The moment that changed my life… I’m proud of that moment, I really do, coding is my passion, I can’t imagine a life without code.

As the days passed, I got more in depth into the programming world, first I started with browsing the web and video games, then into hacking, and finally I made the transition to coding.

When I finally understood how computers worked (specifically software) I got more in love with them, I just knew how to program computers to do what I want them to do! That was amazing.

> I started to code with Python in Windows (I’m now coding with Ruby in Mac OSX).

I know what you are thinking… What’s this related to *“FUCKING LAUNCH”* and *“procrastination * 1,000”*?

Well, everything… **The moment I met with the power of code I let my imagination to evolve**.

And I started to get wonderful ideas.

<br/>

## Mind Overflow ##

Since then, I got lots of ideas stuck in my head, ideas that I knew they were somewhat possible to do, I started to write each one of them.

Whenever I got a new idea, I quickly wrote it, because I knew someday I was going to build it.

Hell, I even drew fucking diagrams, sketches and explanations on the bathroom glass wall when showering with hot water.

![Coding](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-d6DlHbfvugigzuDHQWErg.jpeg){: .md-image .image-to-center}

I got piles of papers, napkins, post-its, photos, even audio recordings, phone notes, word documents and whatever you could imagine that’s writable, all filled with ideas that came to me at anytime, anywhere.

> Today I counted them, one by one, 527 fucking ideas.

I kept doing that from the day I learned how to code until today, and I’m not regretted at all, fuck it’s my entire life, but then I realised that I needed to actually get shit done.

<br/>

## Ideas are Worthless, Execution is Everything ##

![Ideas](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4_2R6LQhXwvdQlZ43CmjXA.png){: .md-image .image-to-center}

Who do you think it’s more valuable? A person with thousands of ideas but none of them executed or a person with 10 ideas but half of them executed?

> It’s 50% over 0%.

When you got tons of ideas you need to take advantage of them, so go and execute! One by one, just **FUCKING LAUNCH**.

I understand, there’s that big problem… *Time*.

You see? Time is our enemy.

I often find people saying, *“I wish I had time to do that”*.

Seriously? **Just get the fuck up and start working on your shit**.

![Time](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ogQ4lMxnCtIBQs2qF6pcIQ.png){: .md-image .image-to-center}

Do you prefer to wait for the next Monday? Next month? Next year?

Hell no, start now.

![Time](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*HLvaQ2b9OIVj9Jk2Is8Txg.png){: .md-image .image-to-center}

Now that we agree that ideas are worthless, and what matters is the execution, we can talk about…

<br/>

## Stop Daydreaming ##

![Daydreaming](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gvrDt6NcUWtWmTD_8mMHsA.jpeg){: .md-image .image-to-center}

<p style="text-align:center;"><small>Image from <a href="http://thedreamersof.tumblr.com/quit-tips">http://thedreamersof.tumblr.com/quit-tips</a></small></p>

Had you ever experienced daydreaming in the last couple of months, weeks or days? Well, let me tell you that everyone in this world had met Mr. Daydream.

> Mr. Daydream is… Sometimes good, sometimes bad.

Let me explain why.

*Daydreaming gives us ambition, guidance, goals and… Dreams*.

That’s generally good, but…

*Daydreaming also gives us distortioned reality, false beliefs, and… Just dreams*.

In other words… **Falseness**.

So use it with caution, there’s a problem with dreaming too high.

What I’m trying to say is… **Stop daydreaming, make it real**.

If you want to live the life of your dreams, you need to **stop dreaming and start doing**, that’s obvious, isn’t?

> We need to wake up.

I’ve been daydreaming my entire fucking life, and sometimes it’s like if I’m living a fake life because I have lots of undisclosed desires.

What do you say in those cases? You say…

<br/>

## Fuck Resistance ##

![Resistance](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*TPPy3uZjATxGRbdPVVa7sA.png){: .md-image .image-to-center}

> Resistance is fear, self-doubt, procrastination, addiction, distraction, timidity, ego and narcissism, self-loathing, perfectionism, etc.

Here is an excerpt taken from the awesome book “Do the Work” by Steven Pressfield (highly recommend it) about what Resistance does and why it is poison for your life.

> “Resistance’s goal is not to wound or disable. Resistance aims to kill. Its target is the epicenter of our being: our genius, our soul, the unique and priceless gift we were put on this earth to give and that no one else has but us. Resistance means business. When we fight it, we are in a war to the death.” — Steven Pressfield

Resistance is standing between you and your desired life, so **fight, and don’t give up!**

I’m prepared to defeat Resistance, are you?

I’ll tell you what’s my weapon for my fight against Resistance.

The blood behind the **FUCKING LAUNCH** challenge.

So… **What’s your weapon?**

Whatever you choose, do not miss it, use it with all your will power and strength, you only got ONE life, and remember, time is running out.

<br/>

## Do Not Overplan ##

![Overplanning](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*iZ7B9bh5knhP8Sz9A1UpGw.png){: .md-image .image-to-center}

I know I know, you may be a perfectionist (I’m one as well) but believe me, perfectionism is killing you, it is a double-edged sword, you either learn to control you perfectionism or it may consume you, it’s a constant inner battle between your perfectionist side and your productive side.

Perfectionism is akin to overplanning or overthinking, and that stops you from the **FUCKING LAUNCH**.

Don’t get me wrong, perfectionism is a great power, but as Uncle Ben said:

> With great power comes great responsibility.

So do not overplan, and that’s not only applicable to your products or ideas, but to your mind as well, don’t overthink what’s going on around you so much, just **FUCKING LAUNCH!**

Trust me, just do the things, you want to have a better body? Good news, I’ve got the secret: go to the gym, train hard, eat healthy, sleep well, repeat.

That’s all, you don’t need to be in the best gym of the city, or with the best coach available, or wear the best training suit to achieve a better body, you just need to do the fucking things and stop overplanning/overthinking.

It’s the same with everything in life.

> Launch quick, fix later.

In product development, that’s why MVP’s were created for.

> Done is better than perfect.

So my friend, **stop planning and start doing**.

<br/>

## Learn On the Go ##

Sometimes you’re going to ask yourself “*How am I going to do this?*”, the answer:

> Learn on the go

Yes, you don’t need to be a master at what you need/want to do, that’s a process, a process you’re going to be following just by:

> Practice, practice, practice

We as humans, never stop learning, there are new things to learn and to try every single day, so instead of focusing on mastering something because you think you need it before you apply it, stop there, go build things first, and learn on the go.

> Move fast and break things

<br/>

## Become an Executor ##

![Execute your ideas](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WEYflHJk2XJ85PhxzYJjfw.png){: .md-image .image-to-center}

It’s not just about ideas, execution is everything in everything.

You need to become an executor, that’s the key for productivity, get traction, if you don’t, no one will do it for you.

Stay in the flow, execute, execute, execute… And you’ll be where you want to be in proportion to your executions, so do smart moves.

Go execute! Just **FUCKING LAUNCH**.
